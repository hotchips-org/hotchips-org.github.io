				As a HOT CHIPS sponsor, you will not only dramatically extend your company's presence, you'll also become an essential part of the team that makes the conference possible each year.

Sponsorship, not only gives your company a greater presence at the event, but also gives you exceptional visibility to the HOT CHIPS' attendees over the period of months leading up to the HOT CHIPS conference. Depending on the sponsorship level, your logo will be prominently placed and seen by hundreds of professionals who receive conference mailings, visit this website, and attend the event. Complimentary exhibit space is also included in some sponsorship packages.

Because opportunities are limited, we do suggest that you sign up early. We look forward to working with you as a HOT CHIPS sponsor.


# Sponsorship Levels


Various levels of sponsorship allow you an increased visibility and access to our attendees and professionals. Once you commit your support, your participation will be recognized in print and online publications leading up to the conference.

**Exclusive Sponsor Booth Tables : **Every sponsor is afforded  shared table space as a sponsorship benefit.  However, due to limited table space,  sponsors may have to share booth tables.  Exclusive table space  (one table) is available for $500 extra.  Hurry, because no new sponsor request for table space (shared or exclusive) will be honored after the end of the early registrations deadline.





## Other Sponsorship Opportunities


Customized sponsorship agreements are also available. Some examples are:



 	
  * Sponsoring the acquisition/production of USB flash-drives storing the conference material and distributed to attendees.

 	
  * Sponsoring meal events and coffee breaks.

#  Logo Submission Policy  And Guidelines


As a sponsor, you have the benefit of posting your logo on one or more Hot Chips webpages, printed correspondence and giveaways (when technically feasible).  Hot Chips respects your logo rights and uses the logo only to proudly announce that you are a sponsor.  Beyond this statement, Hot Chips does sign any agreements regarding logo use.  We will gladly accommodate sponsors  who need more information  about how Hot Chips uses their logos.  Posting the logos is a benefit  of - and not a requirement for sponsorship; sponsors can opt not to post their logos on Hot Chips website, printed material, etc. if they wish.

Sponsors who chose to post their logos are kindly asked  to submit  logos for both  online and  printing materials. Please submit two logo files as follows:



 	
  * **For printing materials**: A high-resolution logo in vector format: Please ensure that the vector format is either EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) or AI (Adobe Illustrator) format.

 	
  * **For the web:**  A 200 pixel-wide bitmap either in gif, png or jpg format. The height must be a multiple of four.


We might scale these logos down to either 100-pixel or 50-pixel wide logos for web purposes. If you prefer to submit scaled down versions of your logos, please submit the following optional logo sizes as well:

 	
  * Optional 100-pixel wide, height must be half of that of (2).

 	
  * Optional 50-pixel wide, height must be half of that of (3).

 	
  * Optional Web Site Link. (If you would like us to link your logo to a specific URL, please provide that link.)
