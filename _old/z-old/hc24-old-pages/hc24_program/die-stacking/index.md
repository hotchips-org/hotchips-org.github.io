# Abstract


2.5D/3D die stacking increases aggregate inter-chip bandwidth and shrinks board footprint while reducing I/O latency and energy consumption. By integrating in one package multiple tightly-coupled semiconductor dice – each possibly in a process optimized for power, performance and costs for a particular function – this technology gives system designers additional options to partition and scale solutions efficiently.  Die stacking has already transformed the design of high-end CMOS image sensors, and it promises to also enhance FPGA, graphics and mobile applications.
In Part 1 of this tutorial we will examine the key enabling technologies such as silicon interposer, TSV, micro-bump and assembly integration.  In Part 2 we will cover the design considerations & trade-offs of 2.5D/3D in CAD, ESD and architecture.  Part 3 will showcase how the technology is used in systems and applications for memory integration, optics integration and monolithic die partitioning.

### Process Integration and Challenges in 2.5D and 3D TSV Assembly


Small productions in FPGA and Power amplifier applications show that the TSV technology is close to reality even though the supply chain of this technology is still in question. In my context, starting off TSV making in Si at the foundries, MEOL, BEOL and Assembly processes at the OSATs are passed through to be a product. In this talk the processes for MEOL, BEOL and Assembly will be outlined with the process challenges surfaced out. In addition, some issues related to infrastructure building including capacity will be discussed.

###  Memory Consideration and Heterogeneous Die


Since room sized computers, advances in technology have been utilized to increase performance reduce power and shrink form factors.  Historically new process and packaging technologies have been at the heart of this evolution of ever increasing performance density.   Performance density drives our industry creating new compute form factors and usage models for consumers.   Interposer and 3D are emerging as the next generation of technologies that will continue to drive performance density.   This talk will discuss how die stacking is required by the industry and outline its primary challenges.
