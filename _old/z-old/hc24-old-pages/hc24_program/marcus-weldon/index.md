**The Future of Wireless Networking**




**Abstract.** This talk will discuss the key technology trends that will define the future of wireless networking, focusing on the key role of the network in a world increasingly defined by connecting tablets to the Cloud.  The need for new wireless architectures that take advantage of any spectral resources and reuse these resources over ever-smaller ‘cells’ will be discussed, as well as the need for continuous optimization of the user experience on a per application basis.  The impact these trends will have on the constituent wireless component technologies will also be highlighted.




**Marcus Weldon **is Corporate CTO for Alcatel-Lucent and also a member of Bell Laboratories. In this position he is responsible for co-ordinating the technical strategy across the company and driving technological and architectural innovations into the portfolio. He holds a B.S in Chemistry and Computer Science and a Ph.D. degree in Physical Chemistry from Harvard University. He joined AT&T Bell Labs in 1995, winning several scientific and engineering society awards for his work on electronics and optical materials.




In 2000, Dr. Weldon started work on fiber-based Broadband Access technologies and, in 2005, became the CTO for Broadband Solutions business group in Lucent Technologies, with responsibility for wireline access networks and IPTV. He was subsequently appointed as CTO of the Fixed Access Division and the Wireline Networks Product Division in Alcatel-Lucent following the merger of Alcatel and Lucent in December 2006, with responsibility for xDSL and FTTH, IPTV, Home Networking and IMS. He was one of the primary architects behind the evolution of the Triple Play Service Delivery Architecture to the High Leverage Network™, now the widely accepted industry architecture centered around the principles of ‘all IP, converged wireline/wireless, intelligent, optimized networking’. Together with his CTO team he was also a primary driver behind the groundbreaking and multiple award-winning lightRadio™ architecture for next generation wireless networks. He continues to help drive the company in new portfolio directions, including defining new ‘Cloud-networking’ and ‘network as a platform’ paradigms, as well as the use of sophisticated analytics for optimizing the customer experience and service delivery.
