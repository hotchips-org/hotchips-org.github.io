# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR REGISTERING GROUPS


The Hot Chips registration system provides a means for one person to register a group of attendees at one time.  This allows one person at a company to pay for a group of attendees with one credit card.  To register multiple attendees read the following instructions carefully.

BEFORE you register attendees in group, get the following information from each attendee:



	
  * **Attendee Type: **HOT CHIPS invites attendees in several categories. However group registration is available only to the following three categories:

	
    * Member IEEE

	
    * Non-Member

	
    * Student IEEE Member





Ask your attendee whether they are IEEE member or not. Register your attendees belonging to the same category (For example, Member IEEE) in bulk to get the best pricing. Hot Chips will check all ACM and IEEE membership ID numbers prior to the conference.

	
  * **Attendee Personal Information: **You will need email address, first name and last name for your primary attendee. For the other attendees who will be registered along with this attendee in bulk, only the first and last name along with company affiliation is needed.


AFTER you have the Attendee Type and Personal Information for each attendee proceed as follow:

	
  * Divide your attendees into IEEE member and Non-Member group.

	
  * Go to the online registration portal.

	
  * Enter the email address of one attendee (the primary attendee) in the group and click “OK”. This attendee will receive email confirmation when the registration process is completed. If you are a facilitator who is not attending and registering people in group, you will be able to enter your email address later to receive the email confirmation when the registration process is completed.

	
  * On the “Registration Options” page, select the “Attendee Type”. Group registration is available only for three categories mentioned above. If you select any other attendee type, you will not be able to register multiple attendees as one group.

	
  * On the “Activity” page, select the activities that the primary attendee would like to attend.

	
  * Click on the “Click to add guest” link. Once a guest attendee is added, select the activities that they plan to attend. Make sure you enter the relevant information for the guest by clicking on “Click to enter guest name” link for the guest you just added.

	
  * Continue to add guests until you are done with all the attendees in the group.

	
  * Click “Next”. If the email address that you provided for the primary attendee is not registered with HOT CHIP’s online registration portal, you will be directed to a page to input the information for the primary attendee. The information includes the following required fields:

	
    * First Name

	
    * Last Name

	
    * Phone number

	
    * Password

	
    * Mailing address




	
  * IEEE membership number (if applicable)

	
  * Click “Next” to go to a short questionnaire. Fill out the questionnaire and click “Next”.

	
  * The next screen gives you a summary of all the transactions. This page gives a chance to add another email address to receive the email confirmation when the registration process is completed. If you are a facilitator who is not attending and registering people in your team, you might want to add your email address here so that you can receive an email confirmation.

	
  * Clicking “Next” will take you to the credit card processing page. Fill in the credit card information to pay for the registration and click on “Pay”.

	
  * The credit card will be processed and if the transaction is successful, you will be presented a receipt. You can either print or save the receipt for your records. You will also receive an email confirmation to the email address of the primary registrant and the additional email address if you provided.
