				As a HOT CHIPS sponsor, you will not only dramatically extend your company's presence, you'll also become an essential part of the team that makes the conference possible each year.

Sponsorship, not only gives your company a greater presence at the event, but also gives you exceptional visibility to the HOT CHIPS' attendees over the period of months leading up to the HOT CHIPS conference. Depending on the sponsorship level, your logo will be prominently placed and seen by hundreds of professionals who receive conference mailings, visit this website, and attend the event. Complimentary exhibit space is also included in some sponsorship packages.

Because opportunities are limited, we do suggest that you sign up early. We look forward to working with you as a HOT CHIPS sponsor.
