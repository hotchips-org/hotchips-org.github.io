<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract:**"] I will give a very quick introduction to basic concepts in security. This includes defining what security is, what threat models are, steps in designing a secure hardware system, what security policies are, why access control is important, and what applying cryptography can and cannot do. This will give the newcomer to security an idea of how designing for security is different from designing for performance or power, and will be a quick refresher of important points for more experienced security designers. This material is important to frame our thinking of security designs, and to better understand the following presentations.
**Biography**: Ruby B. Lee is the Forrest G. Hamrick Professor of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University. Her current research is in security-aware computer architecture, secure caches that do not leak information, secure cloud computing, secure virtual machines, smartphone security, running unvetted applications on sensitive data, and security verification. She has also done extensive past work on cryptography acceleration, very fast and novel bit permutation instructions, secure processors and hardware trust anchors. Prior to Princeton, Lee served as chief architect at Hewlett-Packard for processor architecture, multimedia architecture, and then security architecture. She was a founding architect of HP?s PA-RISC architecture and instrumental in the initial design of several generations of PA-RISC processors for HP?s business and technical computers. She helped in the widespread adoption of multimedia in commodity products by pioneering multimedia support in microprocessors and introducing the first real-time software video in low-end products. She was co-leader of the Intel-HP multimedia architecture team for 64-bit microprocessors. She created the first security roadmap for enterprise and e-commerce security for HP.

<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract:**"] Mobile hardware security differs from other computer security in both the ubiquity of mobile devices and the wide range of sophistication of the user community. Mobile solutions need to be physically robust against a range of attacks and also able to interact with a large software community through simple and secure interfaces. This talk describes both the problem and solution space for mobile hardware security, with particular focus on the trusted execution environment approach that allows the secure and non-secure worlds to coexist on the same hardware.
**Biography:** Vikas Chandra is a Principal Engineer in the Corporate R&D group at ARM. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2004.

<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract: **"]I will discuss the two basic tenants of secure systems design: Integrity and Isolation. Integrity, the mechanism by which you can ensure that a system exhibits the intended behavior and Isolation, the mechanism by which you can contain and restrict what a system can do or what can be done to it. I will illustrate both concepts with practical examples of secure boot, authenticated boot, secure hypervisors and physical secure coprocessors as well as the ecosystem elements such as key distribution services and a discussion of integrity challenges in modern SOC designs to make it all work together. The objective of this lecture is to give the student a broad overview of secure systems design elements and how they fit together in practice. The lecture notes contain references for further study.
**Biography:** Dr. Leendert van Doorn is a Corporate Fellow and Corporate VP at AMD where he is responsible for driving software innovation across the company.

<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract:**"] With the advent of IoT technology, a wide variety of electronic devices is expected to be deployed in often inaccessible places. Keeping these space-constrained devices powered up for their intended lifetimes is one of the primary concerns in the widespread adoption of this technology. In this tutorial, I will look at the energy needs of IoT devices, discuss the power delivery architecture and examine self-powered operation. The tutorial will delve into the basics of energy harvesting sources, storage mechanisms (batteries, supercapacitors) and the associated power management circuits needed(low-power DC/DC converters, chargers) to extend the operational lifetime of IoT devices.

<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract:**"] The continuous demand for smaller integrated systems with enhanced computation-ability has led to the Internet-of-Things as a viable concept in real-world applications. Aggressive reduction of the power consumption is a crucial aspect of integrated circuits for IoT, whose voltages typically need to be pushed down to near-threshold (and sometimes even below). This talk addresses the fundamental issues entailed by the operation at near-threshold and below and related solutions. Due to the significantly different performance/energy/resiliency/leakage design tradeoff at ultra-low voltages, this talk provides a fresh view on near-threshold circuits (and below) and debunks several wrong assumptions stemming from traditional low-power common wisdom. To put things in perspective, design trends at near-threshold and below are discussed, including fine-grain voltage distribution/power gating, heterogeneity, specialization, and the strong need for across-boundary design, among the others.
**Biography:** Massimo Alioto (M?01?SM?07) was born in Brescia, Italy, in 1972.

<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract:**"]Industry analysts foresee astonishingly rapid IoT business expansion between now and the end of the decade. Growth will be fueled by technical progress in two areas. First, new generations of IoT-optimized silicon platforms will reduce cost and power consumption while improving wireless network efficiency. Second, open industry standards are evolving to bring Internet-like scale to these new categories of IoT platforms. Standardization will enable independent development of solution components across the entire IoT value-chain, thereby increasing innovation while cutting costs. In this talk, we explore some of the key standards that will enable the INTERNET of Things to reach its full potential.

<td colspan="5" >[spoiler title="**Abstract:**"] The Internet of Everything - where people, places, devices and machines are all interconnected and can easily interact - is emerging rapidly. It is generating enormous demand for data, redefining what gateways must do and requiring a host of new solutions, not the least of which is a common, open framework that enables devices, applications and services from any brand to easily connect and interact. This session will dive into the architectural implications of this transformation, the factors driving it and what is out over the horizon.
** Biography:** Rob Chandhok is president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms and senior vice president of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI). He is responsible for Qualcomm strategies that address how people can take advantage of and benefit from the Internet of Everything, wearable computing and augmented reality as Qualcomm drives the next level of user experience in a massively interconnected and mobile-centric world. These responsibilities include the work he and his team do in helping to align QTI?s software and services initiatives ? and the innovation and development strategies upon which they are based ? for QTI?s mobile software technologies. Specific product offerings from Chandhok?s group ? which develops, tests and commercializes software and hardware products that provide users a ?digital 6th sense? ? include driving the horizontal ecosystem for the Internet of Everything via AllJoynTM, wearable computing via ToqTM and the vision-based computing that underlies Vuforia?sTM augmented reality experiences. Chandhok also leads Qualcomm Internet Services which is responsible for large-scale services, commercial deployments and VoIP solutions for mobile network operators. Previously, Chandhok spearheaded the strategic development for some of Qualcomm?s most significant projects. He was a key member of the management team that developed and launched the company?s Brew mobile software business, and he also led engineering and market development efforts for QChat, VoIP push-to-talk over CDMA IP data, a technology subsequently licensed by Sprint-Nextel. Also, as vice president of engineering and market development, he acted as the chief system architect for MediaFLO. Prior to that, Chandhok served as chief product officer of SunRocket. He established the company?s San Diego offices and brought his vision for IP-based home-centric data communications products and services to the company. Early in his career, Chandhok worked as a research computer scientist for more than 10 years at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. His work was published in the research areas of programming systems and computer-supported collaborative work. In 1993, Chandhok served as president of Within Technology, a company he founded to commercialize research and new product development in the area of computer-mediated communication. Chandhok holds 22 patents in software technologies and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.[/spoiler]
