				Next Sunday, the Hot Chips symposium returns to Silicon Valley for the 28th year. I can remember coming to Hot Chips back in graduate school. I loved the annual opportunity to mingle with the industry giants while immersing myself in the details and die-plots from the latest in silicon innovations.

Over the years those things haven’t changed; Hot Chips is still a great place for social connections and still lines-up relevant presentations from the big iron processors to the most capable power-efficient embedded processors.

I’ll be there next week. Will you?!
