				Today the Hot Chips Committee has unveiled the [program](http://www.hotchips.org/program/) for our upcoming 30th Hot Chips which will take place again at the Flint Center in sunny Cupertino, California, August 19~21. It's a real thrill to talk about this year's program for two reasons--not only because this gem of a conference has continued to grow over the years, attracting engineers from all over the world to hear about each other's latest silicon innovations while chatting and networking in an informal setting, but also because we have a very interesting line-up this year reflecting just how rapidly the silicon landscape is evolving.

Indeed 2018 is a year of evolution as we've seen the rapid rise of artificial intelligence algorithms in many different classes of devices. We have a tutorial and two sessions with 5 presentations devoted to machine learning architectures from corporate and academic teams big and small, to cover the latest in AI. Mythic is going to talk about their new kind of AI technology in FLASH memory. ARM will reveal details of their ML processor. We’ll dive into the NVIDIA Deep Learning Accerator, and Deephi from China will review their specialized AI ASIC. And these are just a few of the eyebrow-raising machine learning sessions this year.

Hot Chips also features two special keynotes, the first a Plenary Keynote on Security, hosted by luminary Dr. John Hennessy. We also have a session on Security with Microsoft speaking on the security platform for Azure Sphere, as well as Google providing details on their Titan security chip. Both sessions covering hardware security methods from two big cloud technology innovators will be fascinating for sure.

Also, we have an interesting tutorial that will demystify Blockchains, quickly becoming important not only for cryptocurrency but in other fields as well.

We will hear from the CPU and GPU giants: AMD featuring their next-gen client chip and Intel with an interesting die-stacked CPU with iGPU plus stacked dGPU.

Xilinx will unveil details for the first time about its adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) with processor-based FPGA fabric. And Xilinx’s CEO, Victor Peng, will share his insights in the second keynote.

And what would a Hot Chips symposium be without the "big iron," the server processors to showcase how innovative the best chip architects can be when pushing performance to the limit. Fujitsu, IBM, Intel and NEC will share details about the architecture behind their high performance processors.

So let me welcome you to attend Hot Chips 30 in Cupertino this Sunday, August 19th through Tuesday, August 21st. And on behalf of the committees, we hope to see you there!
