## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must consist of the following:

* "Presentation" or "Poster"
* Title
* Extended abstract (two pages maximum)
* Presenter's contact information (name, affiliation, job title, address, phone(s), fax, and email)
* Indication whether you have submitted, intend to submit, or have already presented or published a similar or overlapping submission to another conference or journal.
* Indication if you would like the submission to be held confidential.

## Evaluation Critieria

Regular presentation and poster submissions are evaluated by the Program Committee on the basis of: performance of the device(s), degree of innovation, use of advanced technology, potential market significance and anticipated interest to the audience. Both regular presentation slides and posters are published in the Hot Chips proceedings.

## Presentation Guidelines

Presentations at HOT CHIPS are in the form of 30 minute talks using PowerPoint or PDF. Presentation slides will be published in the HOT CHIPS Proceedings. Participants are not required to submit written papers, but a select group will be invited to submit a paper for inclusion in a special issue of IEEE Micro.

## Poster Guidelines

Poster submissions are also accepted from both industry and academia and consist of 4 slides with a one- page summary. In particular, student posters describing applied research performed at a university are encouraged. The most outstanding student poster will receive the Best Student Poster Award.
